Introduction to Version control system: 

- Version control system is a repository of files, where every change is monitored. 
what changes are made, who made the changes and the at what date and time changes are made.

- Easy to track and combine the individual processes using version control system.
- changes will be done to host only after you commit the changes.
- Can create branches and merge the code later to the main repository


Type of version control system

- Centralized version control system (CVCS)(e.g. svn)
- Decentralized/Distributed version control system (DVCS)(e.g. GIT)

CVC: 	repository is located in one place and access is given to different clients
Advantages: 
-Easy to understand. 
-More control over users and access

Drawbacks: 
- dependent on access of servers.
- Can be slower because every command connects to server.
- Branching and merging tools are difficult to use.

DVC:	Each user have its own copy of the repository, not just files but history as well. Git is an example.

Advantages: 
- More powerful and detail change tracking
-No server necessary â€“ all actions except sharing repositories are local (commit offline)
-Faster

Drawbacks:
-Harder to understand
