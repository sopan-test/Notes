1994 i think, Hot summer, 3 pm the time was.. i was playing cricket out side of my house.. 
Suddenly my dad called... "Sopan laukkar ye sachin chan khelto aahe(Sopan jaldi aa sachin achcha khel raha h)"
Well i was not aware of this guy till then.. I asked him, who is Sachin, he told me,
He is the best batsman in Indian team.(Believe me tht was not the hardest thing tht time in Indian team because
good batsman was like trying to see the face of a black guy in dark)
this is how it all started..
My Love towards cricket. and to realize how cricket could be the religion and who is the real god.
After some years I got some senses(You get some when you get old), I started to differentiate between 
good technical orthodox shots and slogs.
Believe me the pleasure that comes by watching tht little GOD play and watching him toying with bowling 
is no where else.
I started to follow him, follow his shots and I dn't know wnn i became the true worshiper of tht man from 
just a fan.
Then at the time in 1996 comes Dravid, I adored his flicks towards leg sides.. 
I started to try those in our matches with cork ball with no pads, no gloves no helmet wht so ever, well as a
result my left leg bone still make little sound when I touch it (I missed most of the shots either ball hitting my leg 
or my bat hitting my ankle and believe me that hurts a lot)
Then comes the most memorable year of Indian cricket year tht made upcoming legend, a LIVING GOD...
Sharjaha, the venue where sachin holds the record for most runs and two greatest innings of all time,
coca cola cup semifinal and final against Australia where match was not between AUS vs IND it was AUS vs Sachin.
He shows the world why he is called GOD in India. And here I became the worshiper of this man
Year 2003, well who can forget the six on Akhter's ball in WC. it was all sachin's worldcup. He single handedly took
India to Finals, but thnks amazing bowling we had to chase 360 that was literally unachievable that time when 
Old Aussie bowling attack is against you with magrath in the side.
The Journey is too long consisting of first batsman to score 200 in history of cricket and Winning the world cup.
Its all gone now, the pleasure, the curiosity of watching match. That holding breath when Sachin is on 90s.
Cricket is no more a religion now. Its a normal sports again.
But thanks to All those memories that you Guys (sachin,dravid,laxman,ganguly,kumble) have given us,,
You were the Golden Era of Indian cricket. and We will miss you in our lives.
The pain of not seeing you on ground is there. But it has to end some day.
Some years ago I keep asking myself, how that day would be when Sachin will retire, tht will be the end of cricket 
for me. Believe me at that very same time when that thought cross my mind i could also feel tears in my eyes.
Well i have tears in my eyes at this very moment.
But those guys can not play cricket forever, it has to end some how, i Guess time has come.
As my finishing note, I thank all those legends who make Indian flag shine all over the world.
I thank Dravid for being that wall for so many years,
Thanks to Ganguly for paying such extra ordinary shots on off sides and sixes hit of spinners,,
thanks to VVS for those nail biting finishes.
thanks to Kumble for holding spin attack for so many years.
And Finally thanks to the man who born to be the GOD
for providing a sheer pleasure, for teaching us the meaning of determination, dedication,temperament, Humbleness.
for make us believe tht there is GOD. for us its you
You are the one that created the concept of one religion and one god.
Because we believe Cricket is the only religion and Sachin is the Only GOD
Have a wonderful life ahead.

Its been More than 1 year... 21nd june 2012.. last day for me (i was not dying of course).. but the last day in b'lore(a small but valuable part of my life)....
Still remember when i was leaving with Koshlendra Soni .. still confused. should i go or stay.. the lovely weather, friends, "Cricket", i knew that time that these were the things that i'll miss... i was going with a plan to come again... but how many times in life u made plans that succeeds....
So even though i was thinking that i'll be back but something was telling me that it might be the last time i am walking on these roads,it might be the last time i am watching swadishta, It might be the last time when i'll get call and a solid voice will blast through it saying: aja ginger pe mai pahuchne wala hu. And the Next time if i'll visit this place it'll be all Nostalgia... and even though i was happy as i was going home but i could also feel the tears as i was leaving behind the one small part of my life.
i'll miss the carom n cricket played in PG.
And One thing i surely remember is "Man Jage" Song played on newly bought Speakers of Rubal.
Even though days were though... but the Quality of memories are not decided on how smoothly they pass but the people around you
Missing Bangalore(Days with Frustration, Friendship,Cricket and GINGER)
Happy birthday Rubal Dandotia and really mujhe yaad nh raha  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
And i might have tempered with dates.. make it +-2.

As I said yesterday Ki barish me bheegne ka maza kuch aur hi hota h.
well let me tell you one more thing.... Doosri baar TEZ baarish me bheegne ka maza aur bhi alag hota hai.
I was feeling like that rain... those heavy and dense drops were purifying me in some way taking something away. For once i thought They were taking away My SINS
So i thanked GOD... yeah.. THE ALMIGHTY GOD for his kindness...
He replied just casually : you idiot that was your sweat that was taken away. I don't care about sins of anybody.

SomeOne asked me: "Hey buddy... why this thing called LIFE is so hard"...
Well I didn't had the answer.. but i thought about one word he spoke of...
Hard Life.... What is it actually....
For most part of my life(well of course when i get in the collage) ... first i thought getting the one you love was the hardest..(well if u get rejected straight away it will be non achivable)
When I get out of the collage i thought finding job was hardest(wellof course it is.. ...hands up on that  )
But now I think about the hardest thing in life that is much harder than finding a job for you is... to think of the past.... to think of the friends u spent time with... 
and to know that those moments were the precious one... and you will not get those back again... THAT IS THE HARDEST PART of my life.....
I had many good friends and they all complain me about "Not Calling Them".. well i m never good at calling.. and i am preety poor in expressing things.. but hey... I miss those moments... I miss those friends... well i miss all of my friends...
